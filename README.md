# nfl-simulation-engine-lite

The purpose of this project is to create a more lightweight, performant, and portable version of my original NFL Simulation Engine ([which can be found here](https://github.com/nishs9/nfl-simulation-engine)). The original project was disorganized and not super straightforward to setup for someone without context. I want this iteration of the project to be easy for anyone to pull and get up and running with minimal hassle. As I make progress, I will add steps to setup the simulation engine locally as well as more detailed information on the implementation details.

You can try out the simulation engine here: https://nfl-sim-engine-site-production.up.railway.app/

Check out `docs/db_setup_cli.md` for an overview of how to setup the backing DB for the sim engine. The tutorial for setting up the simulation engine itself is coming soon.

## References
The data that the engine relies on comes from a public repo provided by nflverse. I use the play-by-play data specifically for this project but the repo has even more detailed data from current and past seasons. All of this data can be accessed and downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases).
