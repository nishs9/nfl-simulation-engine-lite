# nfl-simulation-engine-lite

The purpose of this project is to create a more lightweight, performant, and portable version of my original NFL Simulation Engine ([which can be found here](https://github.com/nishs9/nfl-simulation-engine)).

Checkout `db_setup_cli.md` for an overview of how to setup the backing DB for the sim engine.

## References
The data that the engine relies on comes from a public repo provided by nflverse. I use the play-by-play data specifically for this project but the repo has even more detailed data from current and past seasons. All of this data can be accessed and downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases).
