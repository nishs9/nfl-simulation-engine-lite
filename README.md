# nfl-simulation-engine-lite

The purpose of this project is to create a more lightweight, performant, and portable version of my original NFL Simulation Engine ([which can be found here](https://github.com/nishs9/nfl-simulation-engine)).

The exact manner in which I plan to achieve this is still unclear to me and this is all very much a work in progress...
